AB  - Hypoxia is a common concern in shrimp aquaculture, affecting growth and survival.
      Although recent studies have revealed important insights into hypoxia in shrimp
      and crustaceans, knowledge gaps remain regarding this stressor at the molecular
      level. In the present study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based
      metabolomics approach was employed to characterize the metabolic signatures and
      pathways underlying responses of Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) to
      hypoxia and to identify associated candidate biomarkers. We compared metabolite
      profiles of shrimp haemolymph before (0 h) and after exposure to hypoxia (1 & 2
      h). Dissolved oxygen levels were maintained above 85 % saturation in the control 
      and before hypoxia, and 15 % saturation in the hypoxic stress treatment. Results 
      showed 44 metabolites in shrimp haemolymph that were significantly different
      between before and after hypoxia exposure. These metabolites were energy-related 
      metabolites (e.g., intermediates of citric acid cycle, lactic acid, alanine),
      fatty acids and amino acids. Pathway analysis revealed 17 pathways that were
      significantly affected by hypoxia. The changes in metabolites and pathways
      indicate a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, disturbance in amino acid 
      metabolism, osmoregulation, oxidative damage and Warburg effect-like response
      caused by hypoxic stress. Among the altered metabolites, lactic acid was most
      different between before and after hypoxia exposure and had the highest accurate 
      value for biomarker identification. Future investigations may validate this
      molecule as a stress biomarker in aquaculture. This study contributes to a better
      understanding of hypoxia in shrimp and crustaceans at the metabolic level and
      provides a base for future metabolomics investigations on hypoxia.

TI  - Microbiome of Penaeus vannamei Larvae and Potential Biomarkers Associated With
      High and Low Survival in Shrimp Hatchery Tanks Affected by Acute Hepatopancreatic
      Necrosis Disease.
PG  - 838640
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.838640 [doi]
AB  - Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an emerging bacterial disease 
      of cultured shrimp caused mainly by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which harbors the
      lethal PirAB toxin genes. Although Penaeus vannamei (P. vannamei) postlarvae are 
      susceptible to AHPND, the changes in the bacterial communities through the larval
      stages affected by the disease are unknown. We characterized, through
      high-throughput sequencing, the microbiome of P. vannamei larvae infected with
      AHPND-causing bacteria through the larval stages and compared the microbiome of
      larvae collected from high- and low-survival tanks. A total of 64 tanks from a
      commercial hatchery were sampled at mysis 3, postlarvae 4, postlarvae 7, and
      postlarvae 10 stages. PirAB toxin genes were detected by PCR and confirmed by
      histopathology analysis in 58 tanks. Seven from the 58 AHPND-positive tanks
      exhibited a survival rate higher than 60% at harvest, despite the AHPND
      affectation, being selected for further analysis, whereas 51 tanks exhibited
      survival rates lower than 60%. A random sample of 7 out of these 51
      AHPND-positive tanks was also selected. Samples collected from the selected tanks
      were processed for the microbiome analysis. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of
      the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the samples collected from both the groups
      were sequenced. The Shannon diversity index was significantly lower at the
      low-survival tanks. The microbiomes were significantly different between high-
      and low-survival tanks at M3, PL4, PL7, but not at PL10. Differential abundance
      analysis determined that biomarkers associated with high and low survival in
      shrimp hatchery tanks affected with AHPND. The genera Bacillus, Vibrio, Yangia,
      Roseobacter, Tenacibaculum, Bdellovibrio, Mameliella, and Cognatishimia, among
      others, were enriched in the high-survival tanks. On the other hand, Gilvibacter,
      Marinibacterium, Spongiimonas, Catenococcus, and Sneathiella, among others, were 
      enriched in the low-survival tanks. The results can be used to develop
      applications to prevent losses in shrimp hatchery tanks affected by AHPND.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elemental profiling is a tool that has been proposed to improve the
      traceability of seafood products. Small sources of variation can affect the
      outcome of elemental profiling and therefore pose to lower the overall accuracy
      of analyses. Here, we investigate two potential sources of variation through
      three experiments: laboratory variation (intra-, interlaboratory variation, and
      tissue matrix) and tissue variation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of whitleleg
      shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were obtained from 20 farms in Ecuador and two
      farms in Alabama to be analyzed. In the first experiment of the study, samples
      from Ecuador were analyzed at three different laboratories and compared. Two out 
      of the five elements reported were statistically different across the three
      laboratories (Cu and Se). In the second experiment, the effect of tissue matrix
      (ground vs whole tissue during acid digestion) was investigated. Altogether, five
      out of 29 elements analyzed were statistically different. In the third
      experiment, samples from two farms in Alabama were analyzed to understand the
      variation in element concentrations in different tissues (head on shell on
      (HOSO), headless shell on (HLSO), headless peeled (PLD) and headless peeled and
      deveined (PLDV)). Elemental concentrations varied across tissues, and patterns in
      elemental concentrations were site specific. The samples from the two farms were 
      analyzed with a Random Forest classification model to site x tissue groupings
      with 94% accuracy. CONCLUSION: The result of this study highlights the following:
      1. Consistency in laboratory analysis important in studies that involve element
      concentrations, as minor differences in methodology can propagate as significant 
      differences in results. 2. In shrimp, elements are compartmentalized in different
      tissues and elemental profiling should consistently use the same type of tissue.

AB  - The use of probiotics, prebiotics and dietary fiber has become a common practice 
      in shrimp aquaculture as alternatives to antibiotic treatment. However, not much 
      is known about the metabolic mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics and 
      immunostimulant used in shrimp aquaculture. In this study, a gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics approach was used to 
      characterize metabolite profiles of haemolymph and gills of whiteleg shrimp
      (Penaeus vannamei) exposed to four treatments (cellulose fiber, probiotics with
      Vibrio alginolyticus, a combination of cellulose fiber and V. alginolyticus and a
      control treatment). The cellulose fiber was administrated as a feed additive (100
      mgKg(-1) feed), while the probiotics was applied in the water (10(5) UFCmL(-1)
      culture water). The results showed significant differences in haemolymph
      metabolite profiles of immune stimulated treatments compared to the control and
      among treatments. The combination of cellulose fiber and probiotics resulted in
      greater differences in metabolic profiles, suggesting a better immune stimulation
      with this approach. The changes in haemolymph metabolome of treated shrimp
      reflected several biochemical pathway modifications, including changes in amino
      acid and fatty acid metabolism, disturbances in energy metabolism and
      antimicrobial activity and stress responses. For gill tissues, significant
      differences were only found in lactic acid between the probiotic group and the
      control. Among the altered metabolites, the increases of itaconic acid in
      haemolymph, and lactic acid in both haemolymph and gill tissues of
      immune-stimulated suggest the potential use of these metabolites as biomarkers
      for health assessment in aquaculture.

AB  - Shrimp are a globally traded aquaculture commodity that accounts for a large
      proportion of the monetary value of aquaculture. There are concerns among
      consumers about seafood labeling fraud and environmental sustainability.
      Therefore, the geographic origin of shrimp from retail stores was investigated
      with trace element profiling. 94 shrimp samples were collected from grocery
      stores across the USA, UK, and EU in 70 different grocery stores. The results of 
      24 elements are reported. Shrimp samples were from Thailand, India, Vietnam,
      Indonesia, and Ecuador were shown to have 15 elements that were statistically
      different across labeled country of origin, with Ecuador having unique post hoc
      group membership in 5 of the elements. Based on a classification procedure,
      shrimp were classified to labeled country of origin with an overall accuracy of
      71.2%. Overall, the results suggest that elemental profiling could be a
      traceability tool for classifying samples of shrimp from retail stores.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an important
      shrimp bacterial disease caused by some Vibrio species. The severity of the
      impact of this disease on aquaculture worldwide has made it necessary to develop 
      alternatives to prophylactic antibiotics use, such as the application of
      probiotics. To assess the potential to use probiotics in order to limit the
      detrimental effects of AHNPD, we evaluated the effect of the ILI strain, a Vibrio
      sp. bacterium and efficient shrimp probiotic, using metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene)
      on the gastrointestinal microbiota of shrimp after being challenged with
      AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus. RESULTS: We showed how the gastrointestinal
      microbiome of shrimp varied between healthy and infected organisms. Nevertheless,
      a challenge of working with AHPND-causing Vibrio pathogens and Vibrio-related
      bacteria as probiotics is the potential risk of the probiotic strain becoming
      pathogenic. Consequently, we evaluated whether ILI strain can acquire the plasmid
      pV-AHPND via horizontal transfer and further cause the disease in shrimp.
      Conjugation assays were performed resulting in a high frequency (70%) of colonies
      harboring the pv-AHPND. However, no shrimp mortality was observed when
      transconjugant colonies of the ILI strain were used in a challenge test using
      healthy shrimp. We sequenced the genome of the ILI strain and performed
      comparative genomics analyses using AHPND and non-AHPND Vibrio isolates. Using
      available phylogenetic and phylogenomics analyses, we reclassified the ILI strain
      as Vibrio diabolicus. In summary, this work represents an effort to study the
      role that probiotics play in the normal gastrointestinal shrimp microbiome and in
      AHPND-infected shrimp, showing that the ILI probiotic was able to control
      pathogenic bacterial populations in the host's gastrointestinal tract and
      stimulate the shrimp's survival. The identification of probiotic bacterial
      species that are effective in the host's colonization is important to promote
      animal health and prevent disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes probiotic
      bacteria capable of controlling pathogenic populations of bacteria in the shrimp 
      gastrointestinal tract. Our work provides new insights into the complex dynamics 
      between shrimp and the changes in the microbiota. It also addresses the practical
      application of probiotics to solve problems with pathogens that cause high
      mortality-rate in shrimp farming around the world. Video Abstract.

AB  - Outbreaks of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) have caused serious damage to
      penaeid shrimp aquaculture worldwide. Despite great efforts to characterize the
      virus, the conditions that lead to infection and the infection mechanisms, there 
      is still a lack of understanding regarding these complex virus-host interactions,
      which is needed to develop consistent and effective treatment methods for WSSV.
      In this study, we used a gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based
      metabolomics approach to compare the metabolite profiles of gills, haemolymph and
      hepatopancreas from whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) exposed to WSSV and
      corresponding controls. The results revealed clear discriminations between
      metabolite profiles of WSSV-challenged shrimp and controlled shrimp in each
      tissue. The responses of shrimp gills to WSSV infection were characterized by
      increases of many fatty acids and amino acids in WSSV-challenged shrimp compared 
      to the controls. Changes in haemolymph metabolite profiles include the increased 
      levels of itaconic acid, energy-related metabolites, metabolites in glutathione
      cycle and decrease of amino acids. The WSSV challenge led to the decreases of
      several fatty acids and amino acids and increases of other amino acids, lactic
      acid and other organic compounds (levulinic acid, malonic acid and putrescine) in
      hepatopancreas. These alterations of shrimp metabolites suggest several immune
      responses of shrimp to WSSV in a tissue-specific manner, including upregulation
      of osmoregulation, antimicrobial activity, metabolic rate, gluconeogenesis,
      glutathione pathway in control of oxidative stress and shift from aerobic to
      anaerobic metabolism in shrimp which indicates the Warburg effect. The findings
      from this study provide a better understanding of molecular process of shrimp
      response against WSSV invasion which may be useful for development of disease
      management strategies.

AB  - The present study aimed to diagnose infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) and
      infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) among cultured
      penaeid shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus, n = 120) collected from private farms in 2 
      Egyptian provinces (Damietta and North Sinai) along the Mediterranean coast. The 
      collected shrimp were subjected to clinical examination, histopathology,
      molecular characterization, and phylogenetic analysis. Most of the shrimp
      infected with IMNV showed a distinctive appearance resembling cooked shrimp and
      white necrosis on distal abdominal segments and tail fans. Simultaneously,
      IHHNV-infected cases displayed opaque abdominal muscles, white milky to buff
      mottling on the shell, and a pathognomonic runt-deformity syndrome.
      Histopathological examination of infected specimens revealed muscular edema,
      hemocyte infiltration, deformities, Zenker's necrosis, and eosinophilic
      intra-nuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A). PCR results gave predictable
      amplicon sizes of 139 and 81 bp and confirmed the presence of IMNV and IHHNV with
      a total prevalence of 37.5 and 25%, respectively. A homology search by BLAST
      analysis showed that the retrieved isolates putatively belonged to IMNV and IHHNV
      based on 96.3 to 97% nucleotide identity to the corresponding open reading frame 
      gene of each virus. The phylogenetic analysis clearly showed genetic similarity
      and cross-lineage between our isolates and other isolates from Egypt, the USA,
      Brazil, Indonesia, China, Korea, Taiwan, and Ecuador. In conclusion, gross
      inspection and histopathology may aid in the diagnosis of viral diseases;
      however, molecular tools are indispensable for confirming a possible infection.
      The current study recommends strict regulations during live shrimp transportation
      and implementing health control certificates over all imports and exports,
      especially in developing countries, including Egypt.

AB  - Calcium chloride, methanol, and water in stoichiometric amounts were used for the
      extraction of chitosan from shrimp residues (Farfantepenaeus aztecus). Chitosan
      was characterized by FT-IR, TGA, XRD, SEM, elemental analysis, and (13)C-NMR. The
      yield of chitosan with medium molecular mass was 65.90% (mass of extracted
      chitosan/mass of shrimp residues when the extraction was assisted with stirring
      at 60 degrees C for 20 min and ultrasound at 60 degrees C for 30 min. The
      extracted chitosan had a % DD of 64.06 and 65.87% ((13)C-NMR and FT-IR,
      respectively), thermal decomposition stage at 375 degrees C, porous on its
      surface, and calcite as the main mineral found. The experimental results revealed
      that the saturated solution of calcium chloride in methanol and water could be an
      alternative for the extraction of mineralized chitosan from shrimp residues with 
      thermal stability and porosity.

TI  - Evaluation of a new Argovit as an antiviral agent included in feed to protect the
      shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei against White Spot Syndrome Virus infection.

AB  - In this study, four experimental assays were conducted to evaluate the use of a
      new silver nanoparticle formulation named Argovit-4, which was prepared with
      slight modifications to enhance its biological activity against white spot
      syndrome virus (WSSV) in shrimp culture. The goals of these assays were to (1)
      determine the protective effect of Argovit-4 against WSSV, (2) determine whether 
      Argovit-4 supplemented in feed exhibits toxicity towards shrimp, (3) determine
      whether Argovit-4 as antiviral additive in feed can prevent or delay/reduce
      WSSV-induced shrimp mortality, and (4) determine whether Argovit-4 supplemented
      in feed alters the early stages of the shrimp immune response. In bioassay 1,
      several viral inocula calibrated at 7 SID50(shrimp infectious doses 50% endpoint)
      were exposed to 40, 100, 200 and 1,000 ng/SID50 of Ag(+) and then intramuscularly
      injected into shrimp for 96 h. In bioassay 2, shrimp were fed Argovit-4
      supplemented in feed at different concentrations (10, 100 and 1,000 microg per
      gram of feed) for 192 h. In bioassay 3, shrimp were treated with Argovit-4
      supplemented in feed at different concentrations and then challenged against WSSV
      for 192 h. In bioassay 4, quantitative real-time RT-qPCR was performed to measure
      the transcriptional responses of five immune-relevant genes in haemocytes of
      experimental shrimp treated with Argovit-4 supplemented in feed at 0, 6, 12, 24
      and 48 h. The intramuscularly injected Argovit-4 showed a dose-dependent effect
      (p < 0.05) on the cumulative shrimp mortality from 0-96 h post-infection. In the 
      second bioassay, shrimp fed Argovit-4 supplemented in feed did not show signs of 
      toxicity for the assayed doses over the 192-h experiment. The third and fourth
      bioassays showed that shrimp challenged with WSSV at 1,000 microg/g feed
      exhibited reduced mortality without altering the expression of some immune
      system-related genes according to the observed level of transcriptional. This
      study is the first show that the new Argovit-4 formulation has potential as an
      antiviral additive in feed against WSSV and demonstrates a practical therapeutic 
      strategy to control WSSV and possibly other invertebrate pathogens in shrimp
      aquaculture.

TI  - Effect of mannan oligosaccharides on the microbiota and productivity parameters
      of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp under intensive cultivation in Ecuador.
PG  - 2719
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-59587-y [doi]
AB  - The white leg Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp is of importance to the eastern Pacific
      fisheries and aquaculture industry but suffer from diseases such as the recently 
      emerged early mortality syndrome. Many bacterial pathogens have been identified
      but the L. vannamei microbiota is still poorly known. Using a next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) approach, this work evaluated the impact of the inclusion in the
      diet of mannan oligosaccharide, (MOS, 0.5% w/w), over the L. vannamei microbiota 
      and production behavior of L. vannamei under intensive cultivation in Ecuador.
      The MOS supplementation lasted for 60 days, after which the shrimp in the ponds
      were harvested, and the production data were collected. MOS improved productivity
      outcomes by increasing shrimp survival by 30%. NGS revealed quantitative
      differences in the shrimp microbiota between MOS and control conditions. In the
      treatment with inclusion of dietary MOS, the predominant phylum was
      Actinobacteria (28%); while the control group was dominated by the phylum
      Proteobacteria (30%). MOS has also been linked to an increased prevalence of
      Lactococcus- and Verrucomicrobiaceae-like bacteria. Furthermore, under the
      treatment of MOS, the prevalence of potential opportunistic pathogens, like
      Vibrio, Aeromonas, Bergeyella and Shewanella, was negligible. This may be
      attributable to MOS blocking the adhesion of pathogens to the surfaces of the
      host tissues. Together, these findings point to the fact that the performance
      (survival) improvements of the dietary MOS may be linked to the impact on the
      microbiota, since bacterial lines with pathogenic potential towards shrimps were 
      excluded in the gut.

TI  - The Complete Genome of an Endogenous Nimavirus (Nimav-1_LVa) From the Pacific
      Whiteleg Shrimp Penaeus (Litopenaeus) Vannamei.
LID - E94 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes11010094 [doi]
AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), the lone virus of the genus Whispovirus under
      the family Nimaviridae, is one of the most devastating viruses affecting the
      shrimp farming industry. Knowledge about this virus, in particular, its evolution
      history, has been limited, partly due to its large genome and the lack of other
      closely related free-living viruses for comparative studies. In this study, we
      reconstructed a full-length endogenous nimavirus consensus genome, Nimav-1_LVa
      (279,905 bp), in the genome sequence of Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei breed
      Kehai No. 1 (ASM378908v1). This endogenous virus seemed to insert exclusively
      into the telomeric pentanucleotide microsatellite (TAACC/GGTTA)n. It encoded 117 
      putative genes, with some containing introns, such as g012 (inhibitor of
      apoptosis, IAP), g046 (crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, CHH), g155 (innexin),
      g158 (Bax inhibitor 1 like). More than a dozen Nimav-1_LVa genes are involved in 
      the pathogen-host interactions. We hypothesized that g046, g155, g158, and g227
      (semaphorin 1A like) were recruited host genes for their roles in immune
      regulation. Sequence analysis indicated that a total of 43 WSSV genes belonged to
      the ancestral/core nimavirus gene set, including four genes reported in this
      study: wsv112 (dUTPase), wsv206, wsv226, and wsv308 (nucleocapsid protein). The
      availability of the Nimav-1_LVa sequence would help understand the genetic
      diversity, epidemiology, evolution, and virulence of WSSV.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most virulent pathogens of
      cultured penaeid shrimp. Several control strategies are used commonly to mitigate
      the economic losses caused by the pathogen, such as application of antiviral
      products at farm level. One of the most practical method for the screening of
      potential anti-WSSV products is through challenge tests. Therefore, it is
      essential to develop simple, reproducible and effective bioassays able to
      simulate specific mortality levels. The purpose of this study was to develop a
      simple and reproducible bioassay that simulate different mortality levels by
      varying the proportion of WSSV-infected and noninfected shrimp tissues
      administered to susceptible shrimp during a per os challenge test. This method
      mimics one of the natural transmission routes of WSSV infection in shrimp and
      could be applied to identify potential antiviral products to different cultured
      shrimp species susceptible to WSSV. Here we report: *A simple and economic method
      to evaluate therapeutic antiviral products against WSSV through a challenge test,
      that uses different biomass amounts of WSSV-infected papilla.*Allows to simulate 
      a wide and reproducible range of mortalities observed in shrimp farms.*A
      challenge test that simulates one mode of natural WSSV infection in shrimp.

AB  - To mitigate the economic losses provoked by disease outbreaks, shrimp producers
      employ therapeutic additives. However, important issues such as the toxicity of
      these products on shrimp are not always considered. In vivo toxicity assays
      require a lot of time and large economic and physical resources. Here, we
      describe an in vitro procedure to evaluate the toxicity of functional additives, 
      used in the production of shrimp Penaeus vannamei. This method adapted the cell
      viability assay based on the reduction of tetrazolium salts (MTT) to primary cell
      cultures of shrimp hemocytes. *A simple and reliable tool that requires few
      physical and economic resources to evaluate in short time (6h) the cytotoxic
      effect of therapeutic products and additives to be included in shrimp
      culture*This inexpensive method requires only a modified Hank's balanced salt
      solution (HBSS) containing Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) to keep hemocytes metabolically
      active to successfully carry out the cytotoxicity assay*This toxicity in vitro
      assay does not require exposure of the shrimp to compounds at toxic
      concentrations.

TI  - Intestinal Microbiota of White Shrimp Penaeus vannamei Under Intensive
      Cultivation Conditions in Ecuador.
PG  - 562-568

AB  - The goal of the study was to characterize the intestinal tract bacterial
      microbiota composition of Penaeus vannamei in intensive commercial ponds in
      Ecuador, comparing two shrimp-farming phases: nursery and harvest. Bacterial
      microbiota was examined by sequencing amplicons V2-V3 of the 16S rRNA using Ion
      Torrent technology. Archaea sequences were detected in both phases. Sequence
      analyses revealed quantitative and qualitative differences between the nursery
      phase and the harvest phase in shrimp intestinal microbiota composition. The main
      differences were observed at the phylum level during the nursery phase, and the
      prevailing phyla were CKC4 (37.3%), Proteobacteria (29.8%), Actinobacteria
      (11.6%), and Firmicutes (10.1%). In the harvest phase, the prevailing phyla were 
      Proteobacteria (28.4%), Chloroflexi (19.9%), and Actinobacteria (15.1%). At the
      genus level, microbiota from the nursery phase showed greater relative abundances
      of CKC4 uncultured bacterium (37%) and Escherichia-Shigella (18%). On the
      contrary, in the microbiota of harvested shrimp, the prevailing genera were
      uncultured Caldilinea (19%) and Alphaproteobacteria with no other assigned rate
      (10%). The analysis of similarity ANOSIM test (beta diversity) indicated
      significant differences between the shrimp microbiota for these two farming
      phases. Similarly, alfa-diversity analysis (Chao1) indicated that the microbiota 
      at harvest was far more diverse than the microbiota during the nursery phase,
      which showed a homogeneous composition. These results suggest that shrimp
      microbiota diversify their composition during intensive farming. The present work
      offers the most detailed description of the microbiota of P. vannamei under
      commercial production conditions to date.

AB  - Novel Penicillium-like strains were isolated during the characterization of the
      mycobiota community dynamics associated with shrimp waste composting.
      Phylogenetic analysis of the partial beta-tubulin (BenA) gene and the ribosomal
      DNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) sequences revealed that
      the novel strains were members of section Lanata-Divaricata and were closely
      related to Penicillium infrabuccalum DAOMC 250537T. On the basis of morphological
      and physiological characterization, and phylogenetic analysis, a novel
      Penicillium species, Penicillium pedernalense sp. nov., is proposed. The type
      strain is F01-11T (=CBS 140770T=CECT 20949T), which was isolated from whiteleg
      shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) heads waste compost in the Pedernales region
      (Manabi province, Ecuador).

TI  - Predicting the effects of copper on local population decline of 2 marine
      organisms, cobia fish and whiteleg shrimp, based on avoidance response.
PG  - 405-10
LID - 10.1002/etc.3192 [doi]
AB  - The present study focuses on avoidance response to predict population decline of 
      the marine fish Rachycentron canadum (cobia) and larvae of the estuarine shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei (whiteleg shrimp). Avoidance of approximately 60% was
      recorded for the cobia fry exposed to 1.0 mg Cu/L, 1.60 mg Cu/L, and 1.80 mg
      Cu/L. For the shrimp larvae, avoidance was approximately 80% for all Cu
      concentrations. The population decline of cobia fry was conditioned by avoidance 
      in lower concentrations. However, in higher concentrations mortality begins to
      play an important role. The displacement toward uncontaminated habitats might
      determine shrimp population decline. A Cu-contaminated environment can determine 
      the habitat selection of both species and, therefore, their local population
      decline.

AB  - Viral diseases restrict the development of the world shrimp industry and there
      are few studies on cell response to the presence of viral infections. We
      performed immunohistochemistry assays to characterize hemocytes subpopulations
      involved in the immune process occurring in the LO of Litopenaeus vannamei
      shrimp. Tissue sections of animals that increased their LO spheroids and
      hemocytes infiltration after WSSV induced infection, were used. Three MABs
      namely, 40E10 (recognizing small granule hemocytes), 40E2 (recognizing large
      granule hemocytes), and 41B12, which recognize alpha(2)-macroglobulin were used. 
      Additionally one polyclonal antibody was used against the penaeidins
      antimicrobial peptides, and to detect WSSV a commercial immunohistochemistry kit 
      (DiagXotics) was used. Numerous small granule hemocytes were detected in the
      stromal matrix of LO tubules, whereas large granule hemocytes were less numerous 
      and located mainly in hemal sinuses. The exocytosis of two molecules, which have 
      been related to the phagocytosis process, i.e. penaeidins, and
      alpha(2)-macroglobulin, was detected in the external stromal matrix and the outer
      tubule walls. alpha(2) -macroglobulin inhibits phenoloxidase activity and its
      strong release in LO tissue may explain the absence of melanization in the immune
      processes occurring in it. The immunolabeling of vesicles within the LO spheroids
      with MABs 41B12 40E10 and antipenaedin antibody suggests that LOS are formed by
      phagocytic cells derived from small granule and hyaline hemocytes, with a
      possible role of peneidins and alpha(2)-macroglobulin acting as opsonines.

      Americas.
PG  - 174-83
LID - 10.1016/j.jip.2012.03.006 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp farming in the Americas began to develop in the late 1970s into a
      significant industry. In its first decade of development, the technology used was
      simple and postlarvae (PLs) produced from wild adults and wild caught PLs were
      used for stocking farms. Prior to 1990, there were no World Animal Health
      Organization (OIE) listed diseases, but that changed rapidly commensurate with
      the phenomenal growth of the global shrimp farming industry. There was relatively
      little international trade of live or frozen commodity shrimp between Asia and
      the Americas in those early years, and with a few exceptions, most of the
      diseases known before 1980 were due to disease agents that were opportunistic or 
      part of the shrimps' local environment. Tetrahedral baculovirosis, caused by
      Baculovirus penaei (BP), and necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (NHP) and its
      bacterial agent Hepatobacterium penaei, were among the "American" diseases that
      eventually became OIE listed and have not become established outside of the
      Americas. As the industry grew after 1980, a number of new diseases that soon
      became OIE listed, emerged in the Americas or were introduced from Asia.
      Spherical baculovirus, caused by MBV, although discovered in the Americas in
      imported live Penaeus monodon, was subsequently found to be common in wild and
      farmed Asian, Australian and African penaeids. Infectious hypodermal and
      hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) was introduced from the Philippines in the
      mid 1970s with live P. monodon and was eventually found throughout the Americas
      and subsequently in much of the shrimp farming industry in the eastern
      hemisphere. Taura syndrome emerged in Penaeus vannamei farms in 1991-1992 in
      Ecuador and was transferred to SE Asia with live shrimp by 1999 where it also
      caused severe losses. White Spot Disease (WSD) caused by White spot syndrome
      virus (WSSV) emerged in East Asia in approximately 1992, and spread throughout
      most of the Asian shrimp farming industry by 1994. By 1995, WSSV reached the
      eastern USA via frozen commodity products and it reached the main shrimp farming 
      countries of the Americas located on the Pacific side of the continents by the
      same mechanism in 1999. As is the case in Asia, WSD is the dominant disease
      problem of farmed shrimp in the Americas. The most recent disease to emerge in
      the Americas was infectious myonecrosis caused by IMN virus. As had happened
      before, within 3years of its discovery, the disease had been transferred to SE
      Asia with live P. vannamei, and because of its impact on the industry and
      potential for further spread in was listed by the OIE in 2005. Despite the huge
      negative impact of disease on the shrimp farming industry in the Americas, the
      industry has continued to grow and mature into a more sustainable industry. In
      marked contrast to 15-20years ago when PLs produced from wild adults and wild PLs
      were used to stock farms in the Americas, the industry now relies on domesticated
      lines of broodstock that have undergone selection for desirable characteristics
      including disease resistance.

LID - 10.1021/es2037542 [doi]
AB  - Parallel factor analysis with soft independent modeling by class analogy
      (PARAFAC-SIMCA) was used to analyze fluorescence data from shrimp extracts
      (organic and aqueous phases) to create classification schemes for two species of 
      shrimp from four different countries. Twenty-four shrimp (six from each location:
      Ecuador, Philippines, Thailand, and United States) were studied; two were
      classified as statistical outliers. Using PARAFAC scores from the two aqueous
      fluorescent components and the strongest four components from the organic phase, 
      country of origin was correctly identified at the 95% confidence level for all 22
      remaining specimens; three false positives, at lower confidence levels than the
      true positives, were also indicated. A classification scheme which used all eight
      fluorescent components reproduced the 22 correct classifications and reduced the 
      number of false positives to one. Finally, a scheme using PARAFAC scores from the
      two aqueous fluorescent components and the strongest four components from the
      organic phase, designed to classify according to species, produced 22 correct
      matches with no false positives. Spectral similarities between known chemical
      species and the components identified by PARAFAC are suggested for most cases.
      The results indicate that environmental effects appear in the fluorescence
      fingerprints of shrimp collected in different locations; therefore, fluorescence 
      measurements on shrimp have the potential to permit geographical classification
      of shrimp or, conversely, to permit inferences to be made about the animal's
      environment.

AB  - Taura syndrome virus (TSV) has spread worldwide, causing significant economic
      losses since Taura syndrome was first described in Ecuador in 1992. To determine 
      the prevalence and impact of TSV infection on the shrimp farming industry in
      Taiwan, Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei B. were collected from 220
      farms between 2004 and 2006 for viral detection by reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction. Data showed that the overall TSV prevalence rate was
      20% (43/220 farms). Comparing shrimp growth stages, TSV prevalence rates were 4% 
      for postlarvae, 24% for juveniles, 24% for subadults, 32% for adults, and 5% for 
      brooders. Among TSV-positive farms, average infection incidence was 35% in
      postlarvae farms, 55% in juvenile farms, 39% in subadult farms, 31% in adult
      farms, and 20% in brooder farms. Notably, TSV was also detected in Exopalaemon
      orientis H. from 1 of 10 farms. Tail fans and appendages had red pigmentation,
      which is characteristic of TSV infection. Of shrimp with pathological lesions,
      100% had lesions on tail fans, 88% on appendages, and 80% in gills. Sequence
      comparison using the TSV VP1 (structural protein) gene showed that 9 isolates
      from the farms had 92.3 to 99.5% nucleotide sequence identity with strains in the
      GenBank database from Taiwan (AF406789 and AY355310) and Venezuela (DQ212790).
      This is the first broad epidemiological study of TSV infection in L. vannamei in 
      Taiwan.

TI  - Virus diseases of farmed shrimp in the Western Hemisphere (the Americas): a
      review.
PG  - 110-30
LID - 10.1016/j.jip.2010.09.012 [doi]
AB  - Penaeid shrimp aquaculture is an important industry in the Americas, and the
      industry is based almost entirely on the culture of the Pacific White Shrimp,
      Litopenaeus vannamei. Western Hemisphere shrimp farmers in 14 countries in 2004
      produced more than 200,000 metric tons of shrimp, generated more than $2 billion 
      in revenue, and employed more than 500,000 people. Disease has had a major impact
      on shrimp aquaculture in the Americas since it became a significant commercial
      entity in the 1970s. Diseases due to viruses, rickettsial-like bacteria, true
      bacteria, protozoa, and fungi have emerged as major diseases of farmed shrimp in 
      the region. Many of the bacterial, fungal and protozoan caused diseases are
      managed using improved culture practices, routine sanitation, and the use of
      chemotherapeutics. However, the virus diseases have been far more problematic to 
      manage and they have been responsible for the most costly epizootics. Examples
      include the Taura syndrome pandemic that began in 1991-1992 when the disease
      emerged in Ecuador, and the subsequent White Spot Disease pandemic that followed 
      its introduction to Central America from Asia in 1999. Because of their
      socioeconomic significance to shrimp farming, seven of the nine crustacean
      diseases listed by the World Animal Organization (OIE) are virus diseases of
      shrimp. Of the seven virus diseases of penaeid shrimp, five are native to the
      Americas or have become enzootic following their introduction. The shrimp virus
      diseases in the Americas are increasingly being managed by exclusion using a
      combination of biosecurity and the practice of culturing domesticated specific
      pathogen-free (SPF) stocks or specific pathogen-resistant (SPR) stocks. Despite
      the significant challenges posed by disease, the shrimp farming industry of the
      Americas has responded to the challenges posed by disease and it has developed
      methods to manage its diseases and mature into a sustainable industry.

      Litopenaeus vannamei.
PG  - 82-90
LID - 10.1577/H08-012.1 [doi]
AB  - The virulence of seven geographic isolates of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV;
      genus Whispovirus; China [strain CH1995], Nicaragua [strain N2000], Honduras
      [strain H2000], Ecuador [strains E-L1999 and E-LT2002], and Mexico [strains
      M-M2001 and M-LP2001]) was compared using a series of challenge experiments, each
      lasting 10 d. For each isolate, four quantified dilutions (10(-6), 10(7), 10(-8),
      and 10(-9)) of a viral inoculum were prepared from WSSV-infected shrimp tissue.
      Each viral inoculum was injected into 10 specific pathogen-free juvenile Pacific 
      white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (0.25-1.50 g); controls received injections of 
      marine crustacean physiological saline (3.2%). The minimum dose of viral inoculum
      that killed 50% of injected shrimp (LD50) was calculated for dilution, tissue
      concentration, and viral DNA amount. The CH1995 and M-M2001 isolates were the
      least virulent, with LD50 values of 10(-6) to 10(-7) of viral inoculum. The
      isolates could be grouped into three virulence clusters (CH1995 and M-M2001;
      N2000 and E-LT2002; and H2000, E-L1999, and M-LP2001). Virulence clusters were
      not altered by LD50 values based on viral DNA concentration, although a slight
      shifting of order in regards to virulence was seen among the three most virulent 
      isolates (E-L1999, H2000, and M-LP2001). Overall, results indicate that there is 
      a measurable virulence difference among WSSV isolates, which may correspond to
      geographical region.

PG  - 8244-9
LID - 10.1021/jf901658f [doi]
AB  - The role of Customs and Border Protection on shrimp importations into the United 
      States is discussed. The focus of this work is to present evidence that the
      comparison of trace metal data from an imported shrimp sample to an authentic
      reference database using multivariate statistics produces an accurate geographic 
      location of the sample. The authentic reference database includes data from more 
      than 100 sampling sites spread over eight countries along with the accuracy of
      each site relative to its known geographic origin. Potential sources of
      bioaccumulation are briefly discussed; however, it is beyond the scope of this
      work to provide scientific verification of the mechanism for trace metal uptake. 
      Three examples of imported shrimp are provided for demonstrating the exact
      procedure for determining their true countries of origin.

TI  - Development of EST-SSR markers by data mining in three species of shrimp:
      Litopenaeus vannamei, Litopenaeus stylirostris, and Trachypenaeus birdy.
PG  - 554-69
AB  - We report on the data mining of publicly available Litopenaeus vannamei expressed
      sequence tags (ESTs) to generate simple sequence repeat (SSRs) markers and on
      their transferability between related Penaeid shrimp species. Repeat motifs were 
      found in 3.8% of the evaluated ESTs at a frequency of one repeat every 7.8 kb of 
      sequence data. A total of 206 primer pairs were designed, and 112 loci were
      amplified with the highest success in L. vannamei. A high percentage (69%) of
      EST-SSRs were transferable within the genus Litopenaeus. More than half of the
      amplified products were polymorphic in a small testing panel of L. vannamei.
      Evaluation of those primers in a larger testing panel showed that 72% of the
      markers fit Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which shows their utility for population 
      genetic analysis. Additionally, a set of 26 of the EST-SSRs were evaluated for
      Mendelian segregation. A high percentage of monomorphic markers (46%) proved to
      be polymorphic by singles-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis. Because 
      of the high number of ESTs available in public databases, a data mining approach 
      similar to the one outlined here might yield high numbers of SSR markers in many 
      animal taxa.

TI  - Clearing mechanisms of Vibrio vulnificus biotype I in the black tiger shrimp
      Penaeus monodon.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - Vibrio species' infections are a common sequelae to environmental stress or other
      disease processes in shrimp, but the mechanism by which the shrimp eliminate the 
      bacteria is poorly understood. In this study, the penetration, fate and the
      clearing of V. vulnificus were investigated in Penaeus monodon. A bacterial
      disease isolate from a shrimp farm was identified as V. vulnificus biotype I.
      Polyclonal antiserum was raised in rabbits against the bacterium and the
      specificity was verified by ELISA and immunoblot against a range of Vibrio spp.
      and other gram-negative bacteria. The bacteria were then administered to P.
      monodon juveniles by injection, immersion and oral intubation. An indirect
      immunoperoxidase technique was employed in a time course study to follow the
      bacteria and bacterial antigens in the tissue of the shrimp. Bacteria were
      cleared by a common route, regardless of the method of administration.
      Observations in immersion challenge were similar to a combination of those for
      oral and injection challenges. With immersion, bacteria entered the shrimp
      through damaged cuticle or via insertion points of cuticular setae. Shortly after
      entry, whole bacterial cells were observed in the haemolymph and connective
      tissue. They were either phagocytosed by haemocytes, or broken down outside host 
      cells. Haemocytes containing bacterial cells or antigens (HCB) were observed in
      the connective tissue and haemolymph. HCB accumulated around the hepatopancreas, 
      midgut, midgut-caecum, gills, heart and lymphoid organ. Free bacterial antigens
      also accumulated in the heart and lymphoid organ. Bacteria entering through the
      mouth by oral intubation or immersion were broken down so that only soluble or
      very fine particles entered the hepatopancreas. Bacterial antigens passed through
      the hepatopancreas into the haemolymph. Antigens were initially observed in the
      haemolymph sinuses and subsequently accumulated in the heart and lymphoid organ. 
      Bacterial antigens were released from the shrimp, initially through the gills and
      subsequently through hepatopancreatic B-cells, branchial podocytes and
      sub-cuticular podocytes.

TI  - Epizootiology, distribution and the impact on international trade of two penaeid 
      shrimp viruses in the Americas.
PG  - 579-601
AB  - Marine penaeid shrimp are effected by approximately twenty viruses, the majority 
      of which were discovered as a result of their negative effects on aquaculture. In
      the Americas, infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis (IHHN) virus and 
      Taura syndrome (TS) virus have had a significant negative impact on aquaculture
      industries and, in one instance, on a commercial fishery. Both viruses have
      become widely distributed as a consequence of the movement of host stocks for
      aquaculture. IHHN virus (IHHNV) causes catastrophic losses in cultured and wild
      Penaeus stylirostris. In marked contrast, P. vannamei is relatively resistant to 
      IHHN but infection results, nonetheless, in poor culture performance. TS virus
      (TSV) is the 'mirror image' of IHHNV in its effect on P. stylirostris and P.
      vannamei. TSV causes catastrophic losses in P. vannamei, whereas P. stylirostris 
      is highly resistant to TS. In the less than three years since the discovery of
      TSV in Ecuador in 1992, the virus has spread rapidly and caused massive
      production losses in most shrimp-growing countries in the Americas.

TI  - Characterisation of shrimp haemocytes and plasma components by monoclonal
      antibodies.
PG  - 1043-50
AB  - Various haemolymph components of the shrimp Penaeus japonicus were identified and
      characterised by monoclonal antibodies. Three groups of monoclonal antibodies
      were raised. Their reactivity to haemocyte types and/or secreted molecules was
      determined by immunofluorescence and the molecular masses of the antigens were
      analysed by western-blotting. A 170 kDa protein, in reducing conditions, was
      recognized by four panhaemocytic monoclonal antibodies from group 1. This protein
      was present both in the plasma and in the haemocytes from which it appears to be 
      secreted. The shrimp haemocytes were separated by isopycnic centrifugation on a
      Percoll gradient and the different subpopulations were antigenically analysed
      using the two monoclonal antibodies, 40E2-2A and 40E10-2B, from group 2. The
      granular cells were labelled by 40E2-2A which was specific for a protein of 142
      kDa also present in plasma. By comparison, the 40E10-2B monoclonal antibody was
      assumed to be the marker for small hyaline and semigranular cells since the
      granular ones were not labelled. Moreover, the antigen immunoprecipitated by this
      monoclonal antibody was shown to have different molecular masses of 250, 150, 66 
      and 27 kDa under nonreducing conditions. It appeared to be secreted by the
      haemocytes. Some plasma proteins were recognized by the third group of monoclonal
      antibodies. The antibodies, designated 41D11-3A, 42C11-3B and 42E8-3C, all
      immunoprecipitated a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa under
      reduced conditions. The 44E6-3D antibody was specific for a 75 kDa protein under 
      reduced conditions and was shown to be immunoreactive against P. japonicus
      haemocyanin extract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - A 2-year nationwide survey was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration to
      provide current information about filth, decomposition, and microbiological
      contamination of domestic and imported fresh and frozen shrimp. Whole or
      equivalent filth insects, mostly ants, were found in 14.4% of the samples. Of
      countries contributing at least 10 samples for filth analysis, India had the
      highest percentage positive for filth insects (45.5%); the United States had the 
      lowest (6.3%). Filth insect fragments were present in 5.4% of the samples.
      Incidental insects were present in 6.3% of the samples, with flies the most
      commonly found. Of countries contributing at least 10 samples for filth analysis,
      India had the highest percentage positive for incidental insects (27.3%); Ecuador
      had the lowest (2.3%). Unidentified insect fragments were found in 33.3% of the
      samples; cockroach excreta pellets were present in 2.1%, rat or mouse hairs in
      5.7%, and other striated animal hairs in 15.3%. Of countries contributing at
      least 10 samples for filth analysis, the Philippines had the highest percentages 
      positive (30.0 and 50.0%) for rat or mouse hairs and other striated hairs,
      respectively; Malaysia was close behind with 23.1 and 46.2%. Samples from the
      United States had the lowest percentage positive for rat or mouse hairs (0.9%)
      and other striated hairs (7.2%). Listeria spp. were found in 6.8% of the samples;
      Salmonella spp. were found in 8.1%. Some level of decomposition was observed in
      15.4% of the samples tested organoleptically.

TI  - Comparison of the Microbial Quality of Raw Shrimp from China, Ecuador, or Mexico 
      at Both Wholesale and Retail Levels.
PG  - 150-153
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X-57.2.150 [doi]
AB  - Aerobic plate counts (APC), Listeria spp., and Vibrio spp. and antibiotic
      resistance patterns of Vibrio spp. were determined for imported shrimp from
      China, Ecuador, and Mexico obtained from wholesale/frozen and retail/previously
      frozen markets. Statistically significant differences in APC were observed among 
      source countries and wholesale/frozen versus retail/previously frozen samples.
      Wholesale/frozen shrimp products were consistently excellent quality with respect
      to APC; higher contamination levels were observed in retail/previously frozen
      samples. Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes were isolated from 16.7 and 6.7% of
      shrimp samples, respectively. Vibrio spp. were present in 63.3% of the samples,
      more often isolated from shrimp from Mexico or China than Ecuador. The majority
      of isolates were identified as V. parahaemolyticus (36.7%), V. alginolyticus
      (26.7%), or V. vulniftcus (16.7%), and 53.7% were resistant to at least one
      antibiotic. These data reveal that important differences in microbial quality
      occur in raw shrimp products as a function of source and between retail and
      Wholesale products.
